![Big O notation](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*KfZYFUT2OKfjekJlCeYvuQ.jpeg)

good code can describe in two things:

1. Readable
2. Scalable

Big-O notation is what allow us to measure this idea of scalable code that can scale

we can measure the big-O of function using the performance.now()

1. O(n) Linear time
2. O(1) Constant time

## lecture Big O

### section 5 O(n)

- this is linear our number of inputs increase the number of operations increase as well
- the big o depends on the number of inputs

### section 6 O(1)
